# Face-Recognisation-Attendance-Management-System
This repository contains code for facial recognition using openCV and python with a tkinter gui interface. If you want to test the code then run train.py file

Technology used : -openCV (Opensource Computer Vision) -Python -tkinter GUI interface

Here I am working on Face recognition based Attendance Management System by using OpenCV(Python). One can mark thier attendance by simply facing the camera.

How it works :

When we run train.py a window is opened and ask for Enter Id and Enter Name. After enter name and id then we have to click Take Images button. By clicking Take Images camera of running computer is opened and it start taking image sample of person.This Id and Name is stored in folder StudentDetails and file name is StudentDetails.csv. It takes 60 images as sample and store them in folder TrainingImage.
